This was a small project to familiarize myself with using React. Over the course of it, I got comfortable with using and manipulating states, binding functions between components, mounting and unmounting components and more.
Overall, I'm pretty happy with how it came out functionally, though the design leaves _a lot_ to be desired. But that isn't my strong side.
